This repository contains a collection of Java code examples, explanations, and practice questions that cover fundamental Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts. It's designed to help beginners and intermediate programmers solidify their understanding of OOP principles in Java.

Contents
Core OOP Concepts: Detailed explanations and examples for key OOP principles:

Encapsulation
Abstraction
Inheritance
Polymorphism
Code Examples: Java code examples demonstrating each concept, with comments and explanations to guide you through the implementation and usage.

Practice Questions: A set of questions and coding exercises that test understanding of OOP concepts, with sample solutions provided.

Getting Started
Prerequisites
Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher
A Java IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse) or a text editor with Java support
How to Use This Repository
Clone the repository:


Navigate to Concepts and Examples:

Each OOP concept has its own folder with an explanation file (e.g., README.md or .txt) and one or more Java code files.
Open a Java file to see code examples related to that concept, with comments explaining the key points.
Practice Questions:

The practice-questions folder contains Java files with questions or prompts for you to solve.
Try solving each question on your own, and check the solutions folder for sample answers if you need help.

Concepts Overview
Encapsulation
Encapsulation is the principle of bundling the data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit, or class. It also involves restricting direct access to some components.

Abstraction
Abstraction is the concept of hiding complex implementation details and showing only the essential features of an object.

Inheritance
Inheritance is a mechanism where a new class derives properties and behavior from an existing class, promoting code reuse and hierarchical classification.

Polymorphism
Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. It is commonly implemented through method overriding and interfaces.
